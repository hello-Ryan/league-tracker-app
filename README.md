# Currently WIP

## About

Built using Node, NextJS and TailWindCSS.

This is a side project that I'm working on that is using the [League of Legends API](https://developer.riotgames.com/) to track match history and champion winrates.

 The design of the website will take inspiration from both [u.gg](https://u.gg/) and [op.gg](https://www.op.gg/).

For Champion Icons, Runes, etc I will be using [Data Dragon](https://riot-api-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ddragon.html) as my source.




## Getting 
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:4400) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
